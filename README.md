# Small Simple NAT64

This is a simple debugging tool for when you only want to run stateless NAT64 on a single process. This is basically for debugging and testing in production. This tool will allow a developer/administrator the ability to run a service in a IPv6 only environment even if you aernt prepared to go full network or full host NAT64.

## Why?
A couple of reasons

1. It's a program that I would like to have.
2. I thought it would be a fun learning experience.
3. I can't find any other example of this (Theres probably a reason for that).
4. I wanted something to learn Zig with.
