# Simple NAT64

This is a simple debugging tool for when you only want stateless NAT64 for select processes. This tool will allow a developer/administrator the ability to run a service in a IPv6 only environment even if they aren't prepared to go full network or full host NAT64.

## Please be aware
As of right now this is in an experimental state and should not be used. However development is ongoing so check back.

## Why?
A couple of reasons

1. It's a program that I would like to have.
2. I thought it would be a fun learning experience.
3. I can't find any other example of this (There's probably a reason for that).
4. I wanted something to learn Zig with.
